Installation:
=============
	First, let's make sure that PHP is installed and running. Open a terminal and type the php -v command in it. The conclusion should be something like this:
```
php -v

PHP 8.1.2-1ubuntu2.14 (cli) (built: Aug 18 2023 11:41:11) (NTS)
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v4.1.2, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
    with Zend OPcache v8.1.2-1ubuntu2.14, Copyright (c), by Zend Technologies

	If PHP is not installed on your computer yet, then install it using next commands for Debian-based Linux distro:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y php
```

	If some extensions are missing, they can be installed separately:
```
apt install php-<extname>
```

	The next command should be:
```
